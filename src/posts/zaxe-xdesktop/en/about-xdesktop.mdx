Our goal is not just to make great 3D printers, sell them, and be done. We want to create a complete Zaxe 3D Printing Ecosystem to make the process better and easier. To complete this ecosystem, we needed to develop our own software to allow our users to take full control over their production line.

When we started developing xDesktop, we had an idea of what we wanted our slicer to be like. We wanted xDesktop to be the most user-friendly slicer on the market that would work perfectly with both our own Zaxe 3D Printers and 3rd party devices without watering down the options too much.

## Intuitive Interface

To capture the perfect balance between simplicity and user freedom, we created an interface that gives you the basic settings while also granting you the option to experiment with more advanced settings. You will have the choice to adjust the basic things like the layer height, support angle, and fill density but the more advanced options will be set to the default settings we have chosen for your specific filament. So, if you are using a popular filament and don't need specific conditions to print, you can start the printing process in around 3 clicks.

## Remote 3D Printer Control

We wanted our slicer to be the control point of your 3D printer. Downloading an stl. file, slicing it, putting it on a flash disk, and plugging it into your device to even start printing is a long and arduous process that we are looking to eliminate. With Zaxe 3D printers and xDesktop, sending gcode. and stl. files through our wireless system, slicing the model quickly, and starting the printing process are all done through your computer and xDesktop interface.

## Managing Multiple Devices from a Single Point

xDesktop was also developed to be the central point for multiple devices. If you have more than one printer or want to create a big farm of Zaxe 3D Printers, you can easily control every single one of those printers through one software. You can control each print from a single point and monitor how close they are to being done or what devices are available for a new print. xDesktop will be your base of operations for all your 3D printing needs.

## Advanced Slicer Options

While xDesktop automatically adjusts your settings based on the filament you are using, more experienced users can take advantage of the advanced settings that our slicer provides. We design our slicing software as a tool that will help people get the hang of additive manufacturing easily without restricting the more advanced users. You can adjust your support settings to your liking or make custom settings for a filament to get the results you desire.

## Constant Updates

Just like our printers, xDesktop is a work in progress. It is completely usable right now and will give you amazing results but we are still striving to make it better and more user-friendly. Our engineers are making tweaks and tuning the xDesktop to make sure it works better with more filament types and offers a wider selection of options to advanced users. xDesktop will continue to improve and continue to give better results as we improve an already great slicer to be one of the best in the industry.
