For your 3D printer to function at its full potential, basic maintenance will be necessary. While there are businesses out there that do maintenance as a service, acquiring the help of a professional won't always be the most cost and time-effective way. So, knowing how to do basic maintenance is a must-learn for all 3D printer users. 

Zaxe 3D printers were designed to be industrial machines that will print at high quality for a long time. However, like any mechanical device, you will still do some basic maintenance to maximize performance.

Firstly, let's get the basics out of the way. You should always;

- Clean the nozzle every few days,
- Rub the print bed with a damp cloth to make sure there is no residue on it,
- Keep your firmware and all necessary software updated,
- Dust the mechanical parts to prevent dust buildup,
- Make sure that all your calibrations are correct.

You can find more detailed information about cleaning, calibrating, and keeping your 3D printer up to date on our Knowledge Base. In this article, we are going to talk more about the maintenance of your mechanical components rather than keeping them clean or calibrated.

## Lubricating the Motor Guides

To ensure smooth movement, lubricating your Zaxe X3’s motor guides will be important. Restricted movement of the motors can eventually cause them to overheat and even malfunction.

You can find a lubricant in the starter kit we send you with your 3D printer but any standard mechanical oil will be sufficient to lubricate your guides. You can put the lubricant on a cloth or even a paper tissue and apply it to the threaded rods. You can move the print bed up and down to distribute the lubricant evenly. Wipe any access lubricant as it can leave some grimy access on the print bed and gather dust.   

Keep in mind that WD-40 is not a good way to lubricate your motor guides. It can even work counter-productively by stripping your guides of the lubrication they already have, so choose your lubricant correctly.

## Greasing the Print Head

Similar to your motor guides, the print head also needs to be lubricated to function properly. Your print head travels thousands and thousands of kilometers along the rails in a 3D printer's lifetime after all. To minimize metal parts scraping together you will have to lubricate it. 

Just like with your motor guides, any mechanical lubricant, including the one we send you with your Zaxe 3D printer will get the job done. Put it on a cloth and rub it along the rails to ensure smooth print head movement.

## Adjusting Belt Tension 

Your belt should be tight enough not to have any visible sag but not any tighter than that. If you adjust it too tight, the service life of the belt will decrease significantly because of the added wear and tear that is caused by the extra tension. 

You can adjust the belt tension from the nobs that are over and under the belt near the motor using one of the keys that we put on your starter kit. Turning the nob clockwise will make the belts tighter while turning the nob counter-clockwise will make the belts looser.

We advise all our users not to bother with adjusting the belt tension unless there is a problem with it. We use countless Zaxe X3s on our farm 24/7 and we barely need to change anything unless we are sure there is a problem with it.

## Changing the Nozzle 

Changing the nozzle will be relatively simple. 

- First, you will have to heat the print head so the heater block expands and makes it easier for you to remove the nozzle. You can go to the Settings menu on your Zaxe X3 and choose the Change Nozzle option for this.  
- Then you will have to stabilize the heater block using a standard wrench so it doesn’t move when you are removing the nozzle. 
- You can remove the nozzle by placing the key on the nozzle and turning it counterclockwise. 
- Put the new nozzle in before the heater block cools down, screw it and you are good to go.

How often you have to change your nozzle will depend on the nozzle you use, the filament types you use, and how often you use your 3D printer. You can keep using the same nozzle until you start experiencing problems.

## Replacing the HEPA Filter 

The HEPA filter helps reduce the plastic particles that your Zaxe X3 releases into the environment. Like some of the other parts in your 3D printer, your filter will also have a service life. We recommend changing it every 1000 hours of printing. 

Changing the filter is extremely easy. Just pull out the case of the filter from the backend of the chamber, remove the filter from the case, and put a new one in. Your Zaxe 3D printer will warn you when the filter has been used for too long. So, when you get the warning, you will know you should change the HEPA filter in the near future.
