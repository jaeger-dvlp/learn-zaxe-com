When you are using your 3D printer, you will eventually have to change the filament in your device. This process is extremely easy and can be done even by people who are using the 3D printer for the first time with relative ease. 

First of all, if you already have a filament installed, you will have to unload it.

- Go to the **Settings** menu on your device, 
- Press on **Filament Settings**, 
- Choose **Unload Filament**, 
- Wait for your extruder to get hot,
- When the heating up process is over, pull the filament out of the print head.

Now for the installation part. After confirming that there is no filament installed in your 3D printer,

- Place the spool on the spool holder behind your Zaxe X3,
- Make sure the filament in your spool is not tangled in of itself, 
- Before you load the filament, make sure to cut the tip of your filament at <span className="text-zaxe">**a 45° approximately**</span>.
<AlertBox alertType="info">
**Pro Tip:** Place the spool in a way that the tip of the filament goes from the bottom of the spool, upwards to the filament insertion hole to decrease the chances of the filament getting stuck. The rotation of the spool should be clockwise,

- Go to the Settings menu on your device,
- Press on Filament Settings 
- Choose Load Filament
- Enter the filament type you want to install
- Insert the filament through the filament sensor space at the back of your device
- Feed the filament through the filament tube until it gets out of the tip
- Put the filament in the opening at the top of your print head and push it in and push it in until you feel it fit right between the gears inside your extruder, 
- Your device will ask you if you put the filament in, press **OK**,
- There will be a little bit of filament coming out of your extruder, if you had a filament of a different color before, wait until it gets fully extruded and the new filament starts coming out,
- Clean the excess filament and the process is done.

The Zaxe interface will accompany you through the way if you ever feel stuck so that you don’t feel stuck through the process. If you ever need to install a new filament, you can repeat the process as we described above. The installation method stays pretty much the same for different filament types. Just be sure to choose the right filament type when your device asks you the filament type you want to install.
