Periodically, a new version of the Zaxe X3 firmware is released. To ensure that your Zaxe X3 has the latest features,
we recommend keeping the firmware updated. This can be performed on the Zaxe X3 when connected to a network or via USB.
When updating from firmware 5.1.x and older, a stepping stone firmware version (5.1.94) must be installed first.
If you are updating from firmware 5.1.x or older, download both files below (.tar and .tar.sig) onto the root folder of your USB stick.

### Import libraries

In March 2020, Zaxe introduced a new version of the Zaxe X3. The two versions have different
electronics boards that require different firmware files. Read about the differences between the two versions on this page.

```py
from cura.ZaxeCodeWriter import ZaxeCodeWriter
from UM.Mesh.MeshWriter import MeshWriter #For the binary mode flag.

from UM.i18n import i18nCatalog
catalog = i18nCatalog("cura")
```

## Define the Functions

When updating from firmware 5.1.x and older, a stepping stone firmware version (5.1.94) must be installed first.
If you are updating from firmware 5.1.x or older, download both files below (.tar and .tar.sig) onto the root folder of your USB stick.

```py
def getMetaData():
    return {
        "mesh_writer": {
            "output": [{
                "extension": "zaxe",
                "description": catalog.i18nc("@item:inlistbox", "Zaxe File"),
                "mode": MeshWriter.OutputMode.BinaryMode,
                "mime_type": "application/zaxe",
                "device_specific": True
            }]
        }
    }

def register(app):
    return { "mesh_writer": ZaxeCodeWriter() }
