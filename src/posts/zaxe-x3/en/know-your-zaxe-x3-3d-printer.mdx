Zaxe X3 3D Printer is the latest model of our X production line we have developed to be a user-friendly solution to all your industrial 3D printing needs. It was designed as a smaller, more compact alternative to our Z production line without compromising on power and capability. 

Here are the features that define Zaxe X3.

## Fully Automatic Calibration

The calibration process can be hard to master for people who are new to additive manufacturing. Even if you are a veteran of 3D printing, the amount of time it takes to calibrate your 3D printer will eventually add up.

As Zaxe, we equipped our X3 model with a system to automate your calibration and eliminate guesswork and make 3D printing easier. With Zaxe X3’s fully automatic calibration feature, every user can achieve perfect calibration the first time they use their 3D printer.

## Compact Design 

After we were done with the development of Zaxe X3, we realized that there was a need for more compact and affordable industrial printers. Not every single manufacturer needed a huge printing space or could afford to buy a machine of that caliber. 

Zaxe X3 was developed to be a smaller and more budget-friendly alternative to Zaxe X3. With a printing volume of 220 x 230 x 250 mm, it gives you a more compact industrial printing experience without compromising on power.  

## Passive Heated Chamber

Creating a stable printing environment is crucial for a 3D printer that is expected to give consistent, repeatable results. Especially when you are printing with materials that are hard to work with due to their unique physical properties. 

Zaxe X3’s passive heated chamber keeps the temperatures in the printing area consistent which guarantees optimal results with filaments that require exact temperatures for good printing quality. 

## Core XY Mechanics 

3D printer users always have to make a choice between speed and quality. You can reach great printing speed with some machines but will have to compromise on the quality. Or if you want amazing printing quality, it will take some time before your print is done. 

The Core XY system gives you the best of both worlds with its strong and stable structure. You can achieve amazing accuracy and resolution with high-speed thanks to the mechanical structure of the Core XY system.

## E3D V6 Titanium Hotend

The quality of your hotend will determine the performance of your 3D printer. You will need a hotend that can handle the speed and the workload of your production line to boost productivity and the agility of your manufacturing methods.

E3D’s flagship V6 Titanium Hotend can reach up to 300°C easily and allow you to work with most filaments you want with its all-metal structure. V6 Titanium Hotend will allow you to print without any fear of clogging for a long time. 

## 25-Micron Printing Resolution 

Some parts that you will use your Zaxe X3 to print will require very high resolutions for either visual appeal or fit and function. We wanted to give our users the option to reach high levels of resolution in their prints.

Zaxe X3 3D Printer gives you the ability to get amazing printing quality, at high speed in 25-micron resolution while also supporting nozzle types that are as big as 600-micron. Have the ability to choose between amazing resolution and a faster printing rate.

## Extensive Filament Support

Depending on your field, you will need to use different materials to print the things you need. While most 3D printers have the ability to print with basic filament, we wanted to take that a step further and grant the freedom of choice to our users.

Zaxe 3D Printers can support a wide variety of filaments including ABS, PLA, PETG, FLEX, ASA, PC, NYLON, PA, Carbon Fiber, and most blended materials like wood, copper, and metal-filled filaments.

### Spool Holder

The spool holder which is compatible with different sizes of spool enhances user freedom and supports production flexibility. 

<br/>

### Cooling and Air Conditioning 

We designed a highly optimized cooling system to cool down xBoard to eliminate the chance of overheating during intense production 

<br/>

### 110° Swing Door

<br/>

We designed a hinge system with a 110° opening angle which allows users to get inside the machine comfortably for maintenance. 

<br/>

### HEPA Filter

Responsible, environmentally friendly, and reliable. X3 comes with a HEPA Filter that is designed to prevent the releases of odor and harmful particles that occur while printing.  

<br/>

### Secure & Stable

Equipped with many safety features, your X3 will provide you with a stable and safe printing experience. 

<br/>

### NFC Sensor

The NFC sensor will detect the color and the type of filament automatically and tell you exactly how much material you have left. 

<br/>

### Filament Sensor

The built-in filament sensor will inform you whether a filament is installed or not. 

<br/>

### Touch Screen 

Experience the convenience of adjusting all your settings with a couple of simple touches with X3’s 5” capacitive touchscreen. 

<br/>

### Power Loss Recovery

There is no need to fear a power outage with Zaxe 3D printers. The system power loss recovery system will stop your 3D printer and the process will restart automatically when the power is restored.
