Calibration is one of the hardest aspects of 3D printing to master. Even if you have been doing it for years, there is a chance that something will go wrong. Maybe the first layer wonâ€™t stick, the nozzle will scrape on the print bed or the layers will shift during printing.

As Zaxe, we developed our fully automatic calibration system to make the process easier for all of our users. But there are still a couple of settings you might want to adjust to make sure you get the best results you can.

Remember, not every single one of these steps has to be done whenever you use your Zaxe Z3 3D Printer. Maybe repeating the procedure will benefit you when you use your 3D printer for a long time without calibrating it or after you move your device from one room to another. But don't waste your time calibrating too frequently. 

## What is Calibration?	

Calibration is the process of adjusting different aspects, settings, and axis of your 3D printing components in relation to their place from the extruder. When the calibration process is over, your print bed should be in the perfect place for your extruder to start printing with no problem.

If the terms we use sound unfamiliar to you, donâ€™t worry as our user-friendly interface and the visuals we put on settings screens will be useful for you when you are trying to learn the concepts. Just follow the instructions we provide you and you should be completely fine. 

## Your First Perfect Calibration with Zaxe Z3

We will go step by step with this and basically hold your hand through the calibration process to make sure you get it right the first time. We will also explain each step so you understand your 3D printer better. The interface of Zaxe Z3 is fairly simple and most of the process is automated, so we doubt you will face a lot of problems even with the steps that are not automated.

### Adjust the Filament Settings 

First of all, you will have to make sure there is filament installed in your 3D printer. As redundant as it sounds, after using a 3D printer multiple times a day you are bound to forget if there is a filament installed or if there is even enough material on the spool. 

Entering the correct filament type is also important as it will be relevant when you are adjusting the Z-Offset of the machine. Different filaments have different physical properties so the calibration process will slightly defer.

### Start the Bed Calibration Process

Go to the **Main Menu**, press on **Settings**, and then select the **Bed Calibration** option. The interface will give you a warning about how this will reset your Z-Offset but it is nothing to worry about.

Then your print bed and extruder will start heating up. If the LED light inside your 3D printer is red, that means they are still warming up. When the LED lights turn yellow, that means the calibration process has successfully begun.

### Wait for the Sensors to Calibrate the Z-Tilt

Now your print bed will start adjusting itself to become as flat as possible. The printing volume of our Zaxe Z3 model is a very impressive 400 x 300 x 350 mm. That is big even by industrial 3D printer standards. It can be challenging to keep a surface that big completely flat at all times.

The three motors under your printer that dictate the Z-Tilt will adjust themselves for a couple of minutes. Then the sensors will examine 20 different spots on your print bed to make sure there are no irregularities or bumps.

### Set the Z-Offset Settings and the First Layer

This will be the step that will require your input the most. You will have to manually adjust the Z-Offset so your first layer sticks to the print bed properly. You will have to adjust the placement of your nozzle in relation to the print bed. If the print bed is too far away from the nozzle, the first layer, and the layers after for that matter, won't stick. If they are too close, then the nozzle will scrape on your print and completely ruin it.

When the Z-Offset calibration begins, your Zaxe Z3 will start printing a zigzag pattern on the print bed. The interface will ask you to adjust the height. Keep in mind that pressing the up key will bring the print bed up, not the nozzle.

The thin layer of material on the print bed should be just stuck on the surface enough to require some push from your fingertip to come off. If it comes off too easily, you need to bring the print bed up. If the nozzle is scraping on the print bed and smooshing the filament, bring the print bed down.

Also seeing the individual layers on the first layer is a good sign because it means the nozzle is not scraping on the print.

### Start Printing ðŸŽ‰

Now that the calibration is over and you are sure that your first layer is stuck properly, you can start printing whatever you want. Some of these steps we mention get adjusted every print automatically and some donâ€™t. You wonâ€™t need to calibrate your Zaxe Z3 too often but making an effort to do so every once in a while will allow you to get better results.
