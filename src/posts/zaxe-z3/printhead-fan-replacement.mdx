Communication between the Android PCB (also called GUI PCB) and the motherboard ensures the printer’s proper operation and allows users to control both the device and printing. The Android PCB regulates the printer’s interface through which users select commands so that the motherboard can properly respond before and during the printing process. Sometimes, data transfer between these two components can be disrupted when connectors on the motherboard become detached or, in the rare case, one of the PCBs is malfunctioning.
Signs that indicate Android-motherboard communication problems include:

1. a notification with the Error #8 or #19,
2. grey/white/black background that displays on the screen upon the printer’s startup or during the printing process,
3. incomplete booting process – the Zortrax’s logo does not disappear from the screen upon the printer’s startup <br/>and the main menu cannot be accessed,
4. problems with firmware update – the whole process freezes and cannot be completed.

Follow the steps from this manual once your printer has one of those issues.
