A wide variety of materials will get liquified, extruded, and eventually get solidified through your printhead in a 3D printer's lifetime. Mixing of different filaments, sticky materials that are hard to clean, and dust building up in your nozzle may eventually cause your extruder to get clogged if you are not careful with your 3D printers' maintenance.
