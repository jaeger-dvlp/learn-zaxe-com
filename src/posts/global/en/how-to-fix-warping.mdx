Warping occurs due to material shrinkage while 3D printing, which causes the corners of the print to lift and detach from the build plate. When plastics are printed, they firstly expand slightly but contract as they cool down. If material contracts too much, this causes the print to bend up from the build plate. Some materials shrink more than others (e.g. PC has a higher shrinkage than PLA), which means there’s a larger chance of warping when using it.

On this page, we will explain how to avoid or minimise print warping.

## Adhesion to the build plate
To prevent warping, you need to ensure that the 3D print adheres well to the build plate. Without good adhesion, your print can become loose. This is particularly common at the corners. There are several ways to improve build plate adhesion, which are explained [here](#).

### Use a heated build plate
The best way to avoid warping is by using a heated build plate. This keeps the material at a temperature just below the point where it solidifies (the glass transition temperature), ensuring it stays flat and connected to the build plate. When you use a heated build plate it is important to use the right temperature. To find the right temperature for your material, please refer to the print profiles in Zaxe xDesktop.

### Ensure the build plate is leveled correctly
It is important that the first print layer of a print is pressed firmly onto the glass plate, to allow it to bond properly. If the distance between the nozzle and build plate is too wide, the material can easily become loose.

The **Zaxe Z3** and **Zaxe X3** use multipoint build plate calibration to compensate for any inaccuracies on the build surface. More information on how to level the Zaxe Z3 build plate can be [found here](#).

If you are experiencing problems with the first print layer, we recommend re-leveling your build plate. You can find out how to do this by reading the following guides:

### Apply an adhesive
To ensure that the print adheres well it is important that the print surface is smooth and clean. There should be no traces of oil or grease on it, as this will worsen the adhesion. When using a heated build plate, it’s recommended that you apply an adhesive to the glass plate. Adhesion methods differ per material – please refer to the [material manuals](#) and [glue guide](#) for further information.
