An FDM 3D printer makes an object by putting layers on top of each other. If there is nothing underneath a part, it makes up for it by building a support. An overhang is an outgoing section that has nothing to support it underneath. When the angle of your becomes too sharp for your setup, your print might get stringy and droopy. This can be solved by printing the model with supports but sometimes that is not an option or you don’t want to do it that way.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> You can play it safe and adhere to the 45-degree rule, which is a general 3D printing rule of thumb that dictates the angle of a supportless overhand shouldn’t exceed 45 degrees.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> This might also be a cooling issue. Maybe your fans are not keeping the printing area cool enough for the filament or your material is getting too droopy because of the high temperatures. Make sure that your fans are working properly and try increasing the fan speed on your 3D printer.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> As in a lot of cases, decreasing the printing speed also seems to solve this problem for a lot of users as a slower printing speed will allow the printed material to cool better.

4. <strong className="list-number">4.</strong> Lowering the extruder temperature can also help with overhangs.

5. <strong className="list-number">5.</strong> If nothing else works, try the same print with adaptive layer heights.
