In FDM 3D printing, your model is printed by hundreds of layers being extruded on top of each other. Every layer sticks to the one under it while they are still in liquid form, which is called adhesion, and creates a solid object. When the layers donâ€™t stick together for one reason or another you will notice a separation in different parts of your print. This will completely ruin the structural integrity of your print and should be avoided.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> Increase the extruder temperature to keep the flow of filament more consistent and allow the material to melt and solidify together with other layers.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> Decreasing the printing speed gives the hotend more time to melt the filament which makes bonding between layers better.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> A clogged nozzle can also cause separation by decreasing the filament flow rate. Cleaning your nozzle every once in a while should help.

4. <strong className="list-number">4.</strong> Keeping the layer height low is also known to ensure better layer adhesion, eliminating this issue.

5. <strong className="list-number">5.</strong> Make sure your filaments are dry.
