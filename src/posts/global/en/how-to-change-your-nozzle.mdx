Like any other 3D printer part, your nozzle will have a service life. After this service life is over, you will need to change it. How often you have to change your nozzle will depend on the nozzle you use, the filament types you use, and how often you operate your 3D printer. You can keep using the same nozzle until you start experiencing problems.
