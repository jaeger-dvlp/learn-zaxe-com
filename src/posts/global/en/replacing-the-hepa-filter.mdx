The HEPA filter helps reduce the plastic particles that your Zaxe Z3 releases into the environment. Like some of the other parts in your 3D printer, your filter will also have a service life. Your Zaxe 3D printer will warn you when the filter has been used for too long. So, when you get the warning, you will know you should change the HEPA filter in the near future.
