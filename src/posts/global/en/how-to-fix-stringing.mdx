title: How to Fix Stringing

If you see very thin strings between the gaps of different parts of your print, you might be experiencing stringing. While stringing will not really ruin the structural integrity of your print, it might still cause your surfaces to have imperfections. The problem itself is the result of extra oozing or leakage that comes from the nozzle in-between spaces where your extruder is supposed to stop extruding.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> If your 3D printer has a retraction option, you should definitely turn it on to prevent stringing. When you enable retraction, your extruder pulls the filament away from the orifice whenever your printhead is over a space where the extruder is supposed to stop.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> You can decrease the printhead temperature to a point where the filament doesn’t get too liquified which causes the material to leak out of the nozzle.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> You can also increase the printing speed so the nozzle has less time to ooze any unwanted material.

4. <strong className="list-number">4.</strong> Cleaning the nozzle can help by improving overall extrusion health.

5. <strong className="list-number">5.</strong> Don’t let your filament get damp or stale.
