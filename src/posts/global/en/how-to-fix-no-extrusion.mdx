Sometimes you will take your eyes off of your print for a minute and the next time you look you will notice that there is no filament coming out of the nozzle. If the print started out fine and something went wrong mid-print, the problem likely has something to do with either the extruder, the filament feeder, or the filament itself.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> Always check your spool before printing to make sure there is enough filament to finish the print. It might sound redundant but for people who use multiple 3D printers daily, it is best to make a habit of checking the spool before printing.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> Cleaning your nozzle regularly might prevent this issue because your nozzle might get clogged if you don’t.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> This problem can sometimes occur when the filament gets tangled up within itself on its spool. To avoid this issue, make sure that the filament on the spool is not loose.

4. <strong className="list-number">4.</strong> Check if your feeder gear is working properly or not. Wear and tear can damage gear to a point where it can’t get a grip on the filament. If they are damaged, try changing them.

5. <strong className="list-number">5.</strong> Inspect the extruder motor and see if it's functioning properly.
