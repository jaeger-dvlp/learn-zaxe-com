The saying "safety first" has the same weight in 3D printing as it does in any other work environment. 3D printers are not inherently dangerous devices, but we advise our users to be careful around them, because negligence may cause unnecessary accidents. Zaxe 3D Printers have strong moving mechanical parts and hot ends that go up to 300°C after all. To avoid any accidents, knowing which parts to be careful with is important and every 3D printer user must be mindful of the potential dangers of 3D printing.

## Hands off the Mechanical Parts 

3D printers have strong mechanical structures that have gears and other moving parts. The moving parts have a chance to get something stuck between them. To avoid this problem, you should always remember;  

<br/>
- Don’t put your hands and fingers near the mechanical parts, 
- Always wear well-fitting clothes that don’t have loose parts that might get stuck on the gears, 
- Make sure that your 3D printer is off before getting near the moving parts.

## Watch the Print Bed
While not being as hot as your hot end, your print bed can go up to 110° C, so you should always be careful around it. Getting in contact with the print bed while it's hot can cause minor burns and should be avoided. Just keep these rules in mind;

<br/>
- Don’t interfere with the printing process,
- Keep the doors of the 3D printer closed while the 3D printer is on,
- Wait for the print bed to cool down before trying to take your print out.

## Don’t Touch the Hot End 

As the name might give away, your hot end will be the hottest part of your 3D printer as it can go up as high as 300° C. Temperatures as high as this can cause more harm than your print bed can, so you should be extra careful with your hot end. When the 3D printer is working ; 

<br/>
- Don't check if the hot end is warm with your hands, 
- Wait for your hot end to cool down before making adjustments on the print head,
- Make sure nothing enters the print head that can burn or melt and cause problems.

## Use A HEPA + Carbon Filter 

3D printers release particles of the material they are printing with during the printing process. These particles won't have a quick effect on your health but prolonged exposure to plastic particles can have a negative effect on your health in the long run. To avoid this, you can;

<br/>
- Make sure that your 3D printer has a filter on, 
- Change the filter after every 1000 hours of printing, 
- Keep the doors and the lid of your Zaxe 3D Printer closed.

## Proper Ventilation

Even with an enclosed system and a HEPA filter, some particles are bound to make their way out of the print chamber. The particle amount will be much higher if you are in a room that has multiple 3D printers working in it. To minimize the negative effect of this you can;

<br/>
- Put your 3D printer in a room with windows,
- If a room with windows is not available, find a room with good ventilation,
- Don’t stay in the printing room for a long time.

## Safety During Post-Processing

Post-processing can also be considered as a part of the printing process and deserves the same amount of caution that you should put during printing. Removing the support of the printed models and things like gluing your print together can harm you in some minor ways if you are not careful. When post-processing;

<br/>
- Wear gloves to protect your hands while removing supports, especially if you are using sharp tools to do so,
- Don’t get exposed to too much acetone when you are using it for smoothening as it may irritate your eyes and lungs, 
- Try not to inhale any glue while gluing your 3D-printed parts.

## The Precautions We Made

Now that you know what you should do for a safer 3D printing experience, we would like to talk about the features that we included in our Zaxe 3D Printers for your safety. When you are working with electronics, unfortunately, fire is always a possibility. To eliminate any chance of this happening in our products we design our electronic system to completely shut down in any sign of trouble.

If you forget your 3D printer open or there is a malfunction that causes the hot end to get too hot, your Zaxe 3D printer will shut itself down. We also paid great attention to the quality of wiring in our products. Subpar wiring can be a fire hazard in and of itself. Insufficient and low-quality wires can cause overheating or loose wiring can get in the way of causing problems like fire hazards and short-circuiting.

Our interface will communicate with the user in case there is something that requires your attention. For example, when the print bed is too hot or heating up, the interface will warn the user. In addition to that, different parts of your Zaxe 3D Printer that you should be careful around, like the hot end, will have yellow caution signs on it.

## General Tips

While we advise safety precautions while using your 3D printers, we don’t want to make it seem like 3D printing is dangerous. If you follow these rules, you will prevent a lot of potential accidents and assure a safe 3D printing experience. But these are not the only things you can do for a safer process. Here are a couple of general tips;

<br/>
- Have a fire extinguisher nearby just in case, 
- Put the 3D printer on a stable surface,
- Use gloves if you need to interfere while the 3D printer is working, 
- Don’t have inflammable materials in close proximity to the device,
- Never leave kids around the 3D printer without adult supervision.
