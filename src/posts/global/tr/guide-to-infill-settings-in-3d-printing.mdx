When you hold something that was 3D printed, you will notice it is usually lighter than something that was manufactured with another method. This is because of the infill density, sometimes called scaffolding, settings that are present in most 3D printers. 

Thanks to adjustable infill density, 3D printers have the ability to make extremely light just like they can make sturdy, durable ones which is another way that additive manufacturing is more agile and versatile than most other manufacturing methods.

But the properties that your infill settings will grant to your products don't end there. You will also have the pattern of the infill that you can change depending on your needs. Choosing the right combination of infill settings can give your product flexibility, and durability and cause it to weigh less while not driving up the production cost and time, so it is best to educate yourself on the subject to improve the performance of your prints 

## What are Infill Settings?

In FDM / FFF 3D printing, when a model is being printed, you can see that the inside of the model is usually printed with a scaffolding-like structure that has spaces in between each cell. Depending on the fill density, the printed cell can be thicker and closer to each other and the pattern being printed can be basic square ones or more complicated structures, like a gyroid.

These different options like density and patterns all have a purpose in 3D printing and are taken advantage of by the users to change the aspects of the manufacturing process. 

## Why Do 3D Printers Use Different Infill Settings? 

Methods like injection molding or CNC don't have the ability to change the inside of the model being manufactured. Injection molding depends on a mold that will be completely filled with a material to make the desired product and CNC requires a blank material that is later cut by a machine to manufacture a product.

Due to additive manufacturing’s nature of producing something from scratch, you can also adjust what the inside of your product will be like. 3D printers use this ability to their advantage for several different reasons, either for convenience, quality or productivity.

### Weight 

By making the inside of your print more hollow, you are also making it lighter. If you are in a field where you need to print large models for presentation or prototyping, decreasing the weight of the print will make transportation and moving the model around much easier.

### Printing Time 

If you are in a hurry and need your model to be printed as fast as possible or the sturdiness of your print doesn't matter and you would rather just print it fast, you can decrease the infill density setting as low as 5% and have your print ready in a fraction of the time it would take compared to a fully solid print.

### Different Properties

The patterns you see inside the model are not just for visuals. They will affect the flexibility, durability, and also printing speed of the model. Different patterns have different properties and will enhance some aspects of your print if you choose the right one.

### Material Usage

You will also waste less material when you are not making the model fully solid. Not only will this save you a lot of material and money in the long run, but it is also very environmentally friendly as you contribute to the production and waste of fewer plastics.

## What Should Your Infill Density Be?

Your slicer or 3D printing software should have a slider for Infill Density in the settings section. This option will determine how hard, heavy, and sturdy or light and frail your end product will be. Adjusting the settings will give different results, so there is no one correct answer to what your infill density should be. It should be determined by the user based on the function of the print.

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-10-percentage.webp",imageALT:"0% - 20% Infill"}}>
### 0%-20%

These prints will be extremely light but also pretty frail. The time that it would take to print a model that was printed with a density of lower than 20% will be much lower but the sturdiness and durability of the model will be highly compromised.

You should use this range of density mostly just for prints that only will serve as visual examples. Prototypes, display models, and figures can use this range and be completely fine but for parts that will have a mechanical purpose, we recommend a much higher infill density.

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-50-percentage.webp",imageALT:"20% - 40% Infill"}}>
### 20%-40%

This will be a moderate range that can be used for a variety of things. A model that was printed in this range can function in a mechanically stressful environment relatively well while requiring very little material to be produced. 

You can print functional spare parts and get good performance from them but the longevity won’t be as good as the higher density settings. It is a good sweet zone for function and printing without making the end product too heavy.

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-90-percentage.webp",imageALT:"40% - 100% Infill"}}>
### 40%-100%
Anything higher than 40%, you will be looking at a highly durable and sturdy print that will have a much longer service time than something you printed with 20% infill density. 

You will use considerably more filament but the tradeoff will be worth it for parts that will be under extreme mechanical stress for a long time, so it is good to invest more time and filament to one print than having to make new ones.

## Infill Patterns and How They Affect Your Print

Patterns can grant your print different characteristics just like how filament types will dictate certain aspects of the printed model. The change will not be as dramatic as it is with the material you are using, but changing the infill pattern can make the end product flexible, more resistant to shock, or extremely light. 

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-grid.webp",imageALT:"Grid Infill Pattern"}}>
### Grid 

This is pretty much the most popular choice given the fact that it is the simplest one. It will be the default option on most slicers and not for nothing. The grid pattern is quickly printed, wastes little material, and also gives your model decent durability.

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-lines.webp",imageALT:"Lines Infill Pattern"}}>
### Lines

Lines is another simple infill pattern that is a popular choice among people who want to get their print out as fast as possible. It is cost-efficient as it wastes the least amount of filament and it gives decent stability to your print from some angles.

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-triangle.webp",imageALT:"Triangle Infill Pattern"}}>
### Triangles

This one will be pretty similar to the grid infill. Not the most cost and time-efficient or the strongest of the infills but it will grant decent stability and durability from each horizontal direction that the triangles were printed in. 
</ColumnImage>

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-triangle.webp",imageALT:"Honeycomb Infill Pattern"}}>
### Honeycomb

The hexagon infill also commonly called honeycomb due to its appearance is a versatile infill pattern with unique characteristics. While it takes a long time to print it gives your model pretty good durability and shock absorption as any type of stress is distributed to a wide area. It also looks great on timelapse videos.

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-gyroid.webp",imageALT:"Gyroid Infill Pattern"}}>
### Gyroid

One of the most unique-looking patterns you can experiment with. It gives your print very good stability and durability from all angles and also some flexibility. The downside of the gyroid pattern is it is not the easiest pattern to print as it has some very complex g-code commands.  
</ColumnImage>

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-concentric.webp",imageALT:"Concentric Infill Pattern"}}>
### Concentric

What you are going to get from the concentric infill pattern highly depends on the density of the print. At lower density levels, concentric will be one of the most flexible infill patterns you can work with from different angles. But when you increase infill density, it will be sturdy and shock absorbent. 
</ColumnImage>

<ColumnImage image={{imageURL:"posts/guide-to-infill-settings-in-3d-printing/img/zaxe-infill-guide-cross.webp",imageALT:"Cross Infill Pattern"}}>
### Cross

The cross pattern gives the print some pretty decent flexibility properties. The spaces in between the crosses allow your print to bend in towards itself more easily than with other patterns and is a good choice for parts that will absorb shock.
</ColumnImage>

## In Conclusion

The best infill density and pattern will depend on what your budget is, how much time and how many 3D printers, the filaments you use and the purpose of the printed product. There is no one size fits all solution to infill settings. 

Mix and match, experiment, and learn more on different infill settings to improve the results you get under different circumstances and get used to weighing in variables to get the best return on your prints.
