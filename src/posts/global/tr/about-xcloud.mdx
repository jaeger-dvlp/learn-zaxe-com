A mobile application was essential for us to complete our Zaxe Ecosystem. Having remote control over your 3D printer from your smartphone makes the experience more convenient and convenience is one of the things that we focus the most on when we are developing new products. 

When we developed xCloud, we wanted to make an application that would allow our users to stay connected to their people wherever they go without having to think about the condition of their printing projects.  

## What is xCloud?

xCloud is Zaxe’s own 3D printing mobile application. It provides the connection between Zaxe 3D Printers and our users to ensure a better 3D printing process. With its Cloud integration and your 3D printer's Wi-Fi module, you will have access to your 3D printer as long as you have a stable internet connection.

### Stay Connected 

As long as you have an internet connection, you can access your Zaxe 3D Printer, check on settings and send certain commands. xCloud will be the link between you and your 3D printer to give you maximum efficiency in manufacturing.

### Live Remote Monitoring

In Zaxe Z3 model, you can watch the printing process live through your smartphone and see if it is going as expected. Being able to see your print’s condition will give you the ability to see what condition your print is without having to be near your 3D printer.

### Multiple Printer Control

For people who have more than one Zaxe 3D Printer or maybe even manage a farm of them, xCloud supports multiple devices. You can control your farm remotely without having to walk up to each printer whenever you want to start printing.

### Instant Feedback

Keeping you posted was one of the most important things for us when we were developing our mobile application. That’s why xCloud will give you notifications as feedback about the state of your 3D printer and prints.

### Updates 

The xCloud in our minds is not even close to being done. We are still working on it to add new features and improve on the old ones. Our goal is to make it the most efficient 3D printing mobile application on the market.
