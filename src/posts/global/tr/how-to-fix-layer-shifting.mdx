title: Katman Kayması Nasıl Çözülür
description: Layer shifting can happen for many reasons and it is sometimes hard to pinpoint what caused it. So, the best way to troubleshoot layer shifting is usually to do some maintenance on your 3D printer. Calibrate it properly, clean the nozzle, make sure everything is okay with the slicer and move on from there.

You will know you are experiencing a layer shifting problem with your print when individual layers of the model are being printed in different places and making your print look like it was sliced horizontally. It will completely ruin your print both visually and functionally which means it should be avoided at all costs.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> Layer shifting can happen for many reasons and it is sometimes hard to pinpoint what caused it. So, the best way to troubleshoot layer shifting is usually to do some maintenance on your 3D printer. Calibrate it properly, clean the nozzle, make sure everything is okay with the slicer and move on from there.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> Check if there is something wrong with the mechanical parts that might be restricting their movement.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> Like many other 3D printing problems, decreasing the printing speed can also solve this issue. If you are printing at a speed higher than what the stepper motors can handle, shifting might occur.

4. <strong className="list-number">4.</strong> Make sure that there is nothing wrong with your extruder or printbed and that they can move freely without getting stuck.

5. <strong className="list-number">5.</strong> Adjusting belt tension might resolve this issue.
