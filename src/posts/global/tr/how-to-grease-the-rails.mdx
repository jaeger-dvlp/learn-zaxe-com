The railing system of your 3D printer needs to be lubricated to allow for healthy print head movement. Your print head travels thousands and thousands of kilometers along the rails in a 3D printer's lifetime after all. To minimize metal parts scraping together you will have to lubricate it. Any type of lubricant will do but we recommend the grease that comes in the toolbox we send with your Zaxe 3D Printer.
