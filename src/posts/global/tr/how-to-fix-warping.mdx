If you frequently print with ABS or ASA, you will probably be familiar with warping. When some filaments cool off and solidify way too quickly than they are supposed to, they can shrink to a certain degree. You will know that your print experienced warping if you see that the bottom corners of the print have detached from the printbed. This will especially be a huge problem for parts that will have mechanical functions and work together with other components.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> Apply glue to the print surface to prevent ensure perfect first layer adhesion.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> Use a heated printbed to keep the bottom parts of your print warm through the printing process.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> Disable the fans to keep the temperatures high to keep the print from cooling off too fast.

4. <strong className="list-number">4.</strong> Use an enclosure or a heated chamber to keep the printing area warm and temperatures consistent if it is available to you.

5. <strong className="list-number">5.</strong> Print with a brim so it helps the print resist the pulling effect caused by the possible warping.
