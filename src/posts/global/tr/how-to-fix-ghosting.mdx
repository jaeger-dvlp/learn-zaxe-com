Ghosting is known by many names in the 3D printing community including ringing and rippling. It is caused by excessive vibrations during the printing process so it is very likely to be a stability issue. It is one of those problems that mostly affect the visual appeal of the print rather than the structural integrity.

<h3>How to fix:</h3>

1. <strong className="list-number">1.</strong> If the belts on your 3D printer are loose, this can make the printhead shake more than usual. Make sure to tighten them up and see if that solves the problem.

2. <strong className="list-number">2.</strong> Putting your 3D printer on a stable base would be a good idea to reduce vibrations and ghosting.

3. <strong className="list-number">3.</strong> Decreasing the printing speed will also reduce ghosting and make the surfaces of your prints smoother.
